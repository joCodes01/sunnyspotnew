# **Sunny Spot Cabin rental app.**

This is a learning project.
PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL.

The task was to create a website with a login gateway where the user can update cabin listings.

**The app displays a list of cabins with details publicly and behind a login there is a dashboard for staff to maintain the public cabin listings.**

Staff can perform Create, Edit, Delete functions on cabin data which updates the public cabin listings for custonmers.
